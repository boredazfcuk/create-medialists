# create-medialists
A script I use to backup a list of what's on my media server

For it to work correctly, you'll need the same number of 'levels' to your media folders.

I have my media folders organised like this:

```
/storage/
    |----- music/
    |       |----- (Artist Name)/
    |               |----- (Album Name 1)/
    |               |----- (Album Name 2)/
    |
    |----- tvshows/
    |       |----- (TV Show Name 1)/
    |       |       |----- (Season 1)/
    |       |       |----- (Season 2)/
    |       |     
    |       |----- (TV Show Name 2)/
    |               |----- (Season 1)/
    |               |----- (Season 2)/
    |
    |----- videos/
           |----- collection/
           |       |----- (Movie Name 1)/
           |       |----- (Movie Name 2)/
           | 
           |----- family/
           |        |----- (Movie Name 1)/
           |        |----- (Movie Name 2)/
           |
           |----- unwatched/
                   |----- (Movie Name 1)/
                   |----- (Movie Name 2)/
```
